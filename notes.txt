1. create matrix of nodes (n*n)
2. Get BSSF
3. Reduce matrix to get lower bound, add to queue

While queue is not empty and time not out
    explore first in queue (prune if greater than bssf), check all other cities except ones already visited (infinity in matrix gets skipped)
        reduce matrix, update bound
        if bound > bssf: prune
        else: add to priority queue


State:
    list of edges so far
    lower bound
    matrix containing state
